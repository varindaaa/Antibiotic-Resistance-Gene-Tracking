# Antibiotic-Resistance-Gene-Tracking
This project analyzes antibiotic resistance genes, specifically from the NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) family. We use tools like NCBI BLAST for sequence similarity, MEGA for phylogenetic analysis, Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQL for structured querying.
